### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I'm Jameem and I develop things for the web. I have been in love with programming ever since I wrote my first line of code to print "Hello world". I am very much enthusiastic about the prospects of blockchain technology and have been experimenting on Ethereum. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Enterprise Resource Planning applications on NodeJS with Express, ReactJS, Postgres and AWS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Microservice architecture.   
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blockchain projects. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me,
